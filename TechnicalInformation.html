		<p></p>
		<p><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> by Robert M. Pirsig (1974) is a 540-page novelistic autobiography. The text is largely a philosophical piece, drawing on Western, Eastern and ancient Greek philosophy. While it bears little outward relation to the discipline of engineering itself, the central theme regarding the question “What is quality?” may be of interest to all. Pirsig is largely known for his authorship of this book and its sequel, <em>Lila</em>.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><em>To Engineer is Human</em> by Henry Petroski (1982) is a 251-page book about the risks and failures in engineering design. Examining cases ranging from the Hyatt Regency Hotel disaster to his personal set of kitchen knives, Petroski gives a wide array of examples and explanations of engineering failures and successes. Petroski also draws from discussions of engineering failure in society, citing cartoons, novels and even poetry, making the book a balanced and thought-provoking read. Petroski is a Professor of Civil Engineering at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman (Revised & Expanded Edition 2013) is a 347-page book on human factors design. Norman draws extensively from his background in psychology and engineering, and gives numerous examples of bad design and its consequences that are encountered in everyday life. Moreover, Norman imparts on the reader a way of thinking about design to prevent human error. Norman is the director of The Design Lab at the University of California, San_Diego.</p>

		<p></p>
		<p><em>The Checklist Manifesto</em> by Atul Gawande (2009) is a 215-page book about the design and implementation of surgical safety checklists. The text is particularly relevant to the University of Washington community, as the UW Medical Center was selected as one of the eight hospitals where the study regarding surgical safety checklists was conducted. Moreover, the book describes how aspects of surgical safety checklists were inspired by flight checklists written by Seattle’s Boeing Company. Gawande is a general and endocrine surgeon at Brigham and Woman’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><em>In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman</em> by William J. Cook (2012) is a 228-page book about the traveling salesman problem, one of the most famous and intensely studied problems in applied mathematics. Those studying operations research will find the Cook’s visual explanations of linear programming, cutting planes and branching particularly useful. The text also serves as an overview of the limitations and challenges of big computing. The origins and applications of the Traveling Salesman problem will be of interest to all. Cook is a professor at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, and was one of the developers of the “Concorde” code to solve traveling salesman problems.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><em>Long-Range Forecasting</em> by J. Scott Armstrong (1978) is a 612-page technical book. As stated in the front matter, one of the objectives was to write a book that is readable and fun to read. Armstrong injects humor throughout in a stark departure from more traditional technical book, and making the text truly enjoyable and the information very practical. The book summarizes empirical research on forecasting and helps the reader select the most appropriate methods for a given forecasting problem and tells the reader how to evaluate forecasting models. Examples are given from a variety of fields. Armstrong is a Professor of Marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><em>The Toyota Way</em> by Jeffrey K. Liker (2004) is a 330-page business text outlining the Toyota Production System, which is the basis for modern-day Lean manufacturing that has become the gold standard in manufacturing management. Liker explains the history of Toyota and the development of their production system, and then outlines how each of the fourteen principles of the system are applied at Toyota and other companies. Liker is a Professor of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
